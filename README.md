![Logo](images/icon.png)

## Introduction

This is is a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension for
[Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) development based on
[Zohar Lee](https://github.com/leafvmaple/)'s
["Nand2Tetris Tools"](https://github.com/leafvmaple/vscode-nand2tetris) and
[Stefano Volpe](https://github.com/FoxySeta)'s
["Mastro NANDo"](https://github.com/foxyseta/nand-ide).

It incoporates [HUJI's version](https://github.com/AvivYaish/nand2tetris_HUJI)
of Nand2Tetris' Software Suite with various Visual Studio Code functionalities.
Features unique to HUJI's version, such as shifts, are fully supported.

This extension is meant for students, instructors, and self-learners who want
to enhance their Nand2Tetris experience.
